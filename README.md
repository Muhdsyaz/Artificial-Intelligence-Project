- Predict the price of crptocurrency using LSTM neural network.
- Visualize the prediction results.


##  B. ABSTRACT 

A Cryptocurrency is a peer-to-peer digital exchange system in which cryptography is used to generate and distribute currency units. This process requires distributed verification of transactions without a central authority. Transaction verification confirms transaction amounts, and whether the payer owns the currency they are trying to spend while ensuring that currency units are not spent twice. This verification process is called mining. Cryptocurrencies use a variety of mining technologies, according to their particular requirements. For instance, certain Cryptocurrencies focus on restricting the number of transactions validated per unit time, while others concentrate on achieving fast, lightweight services. Some mining algorithms are deliberately memory intensive; others are computationally expensive.

## C.  DATASET

In this project, we’ll discuss about prediction in crptocurrency

For each currency, the data is from the day when it was launched or when it started generating some market value. For example for Bitcoin(BTC) the data is from April 28, 2013 to present day. For Ethereum(ETH), it is from August 07,2015 to present day.

The data contains total of 6 main features. The details for them are as follows :

- Close Price – It is the market close price for currency for that particular day.
- Open Price – It is market open price for currency for that day.
- High Price – It is highest price of currency for the day.
- Low Price – It is the lowest price for currency for that day.
- Volume – The volume of currency that is being in trade for that day.
- Market Cap – The total market cap value of currency for that day. It can vary a lot on given day depending upon volatility in prices.

**Ripple (XRP)**
Dataset that we are used for XRP is 1 years which is from 15/4/2020 untill 15/4/2021. We have trained same LSTM model on Ripple data. We are predicting prices from 22 March 2021 to 15 April 2021. Below table shows our output.


![Figure 2](https://i1.wp.com/pirimidtech.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/0-4.jpg?w=592&ssl=1)

Again, overall difference between real and predicted prices is from 0 to 5.6%.


**Ethereum**
For Ethereum also, we are predicting for 21 January to 27 January 2018 to test how we are doing on unseen data. So below table is what we are getting for Ethereum.

![Figure 3](https://i2.wp.com/pirimidtech.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/0-3.jpg?w=592&ssl=1)

As shown above, difference between real and predicted close price is 0% to 7.4%. For really simple LSTM model we’ve trained and tested.

## E   TRAINING THE PREDICTION

We are now ready to train our face mask detector using Keras, TensorFlow, and Deep Learning.

From there, open up a terminal, and execute the following command:
